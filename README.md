- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @joao-nunes
- ðŸ‘€ Currently, I do research on artificial intelligence. My main research interests include the broad fields of Machine Learning and Deep Learning, as well as their applications in medical imaging. I'm particularly interested in precision oncology that I think could greatly bennefit from multiomics (MRI, CT, H&E WSIs, etc.) cancer stratification. My goal is to work in multidisciplinary teams at the intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence, biomedical engineering, and medicine.
