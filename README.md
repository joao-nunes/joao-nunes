- 👋 Hi, I’m @joao-nunes
- 👀 Naturally curious about nature 🌄 and human cognition 🧠, an engineer by training, and passionate about computer vision. My purpose is to serve. I strive to improve my knowledge and to make it available to the scientific and healthcare communities.
- 🛠️ I am a research assistant at the Visual Computing and Machine Intelligence (VCMI) group, INESC TEC, and a PhD student at the Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal, where I am enrolled in the Doctoral Program in Electrical and Computers Engineering (PDEEC). I am holistically interested in data science, machine learning and computer vision, although my main research focus is on computational pathology 💻🔬🦠, domain generalization, causal representation learning, and label-efficient learning paradigms like self-supervised and semi-supervised learning.
